# String

##Description

This repository is made to host string header file so as to bring String functionality to C++.
The files hosted here are coded in the Turbo C++ IDE so might be incompatible with the new standards.
It is specifically useful for the programming beginners who might stumble because of the lack of a String datatype in the older versions of C++.

This repository will contain a .CPP file and a .H file.
You can use the .CPP directly inside the programs.
If you prefer a more modular approach then go for the Header file.
But be sure to paste the Header file in the BIN folder and include it in the program with the statement #include"STRING.H".
